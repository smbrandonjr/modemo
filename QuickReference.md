## 💡 Pro Tips

### 🎯 NEW: Auto-Detection Makes Life Easy!

**No more guessing ports!**
- Tool scans ALL serial ports automatically
- Tests each port with multiple baud rates
- Shows you exactly which ports work
- Recommends the best port for AT commands
- One-click connection if only one modem found

**What auto-detection shows you:**
- ✅ Port path (e.g., /dev/ttyUSB2)
- ✅ Device type (USB Serial, CDC-ACM, UART)
- ✅ Device description (Quectel, Sierra, etc.)
- ✅ Which baud rate works
- ✅ Real-time testing progress

---

### Finding the Right Serial Port (Manual Method)

Multi-port modems usually expose:
- **Port 0**: AT commands (diagnostic)
- **Port 1**: AT commands (alternate)
- **Port 2**: AT commands (primary) ← **Most common**
- **Port 3**: GPS/NMEA (if present)

**With auto-detection**: Tool tells you which ports work!
**Manual priority**: `/dev/ttyUSB2` → `/dev/ttyUSB1` → `/dev/ttyUSB0`

---

### Improving Signal

1. **External antenna**: Always better than internal
2. **Height matters**: Higher is usually better
3. **Line of sight**: Avoid obstacles to tower
4. **Avoid interference**: Distance from WiFi, electronics
5. **Test locations**: Window > interior > basement

---

### When Registration Takes Forever

Network registration can take time:
- **First time**: 60-90 seconds
- **After FPLMN clear**: 30-60 seconds
- **Roaming**: 90-120 seconds
- **Weak signal**: 2-3 minutes

**Don't panic if "Searching" for a minute!**

---

### Data Connection Checklist

For data to work, ALL must be true:
- ✅ Signal quality Fair or better
- ✅ Network registered (status 1 or 5)
- ✅ SIM status READY
- ✅ Correct APN configured
- ✅ PDP context activated
- ✅ IP address assigned
- ✅ GPRS attached

Use "Check Data Connection" to verify all!

### NEW: Data Transfer Test

Want to validate your cellular provider's billing? Test it!

```
Main Menu → APN & Data Connection (4) → Test Data Transfer (7)

1. Choose test size:
   - 1 KB, 10 KB, 100 KB, 1 MB, or custom

2. Review overhead estimate:
   - Payload: Your actual data
   - TCP/IP Headers: ~40 bytes per packet
   - TLS Handshake: ~3 KB for HTTPS
   - DNS Lookup: ~80 bytes
   - HTTP Headers: ~400 bytes

3. Note TOTAL ESTIMATED usage

4. Confirm to send

5. Wait 1-2 minutes

6. Check Hologram Dashboard:
   https://dashboard.hologram.io
   → Your Device → Data Usage

7. Verify increase matches estimate
```

**What You'll See on Dashboard:**
- Total aggregated data (NOT broken down)
- 1 KB payload = ~4.5 KB total billed
- 10 KB payload = ~14 KB total billed
- 100 KB payload = ~105 KB total billed

**Automatic Routing Check (NEW!):**
The tool now verifies routing BEFORE sending data:

```
After confirming test:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐

```

**Routing Fix Options:**

**Option 1: Disable WiFi Temporarily (Recommended)**
- Disables WiFi completely during test
- Ensures ALL traffic uses cellular
- WiFi automatically re-enabled after test
- Requires sudo permissions

**Option 2: Configure Route Automatically (NEW!)**
- Adds temporary route for httpbin.org ONLY
- WiFi stays enabled for other traffic
- Route automatically removed after test
- Perfect for dual-network environments
- Requires sudo permissions

**Option 3: Manual Commands**
- Shows commands you can run yourself
- Useful if automatic methods fail
- Must exit program to run commands

**Automatic Cleanup:**
After each test, the tool automatically:
- ✓ Removes all temporary routes
- ✓ Offers to re-enable WiFi
- ✓ Restores network to original state

When exiting the menu:
- ✓ Warns if routes or WiFi changes still active
- ✓ Offers to clean up before exit

**Tips:**
- Tool handles routing automatically now!
- **Option 1** (disable WiFi): Best for simple setups
- **Option 2** (route config): Best for servers/systems that need WiFi
- Dashboard updates take 1-2 minutes
- Actual may vary ±10% due to network conditions
- Uses real data (costs apply)
